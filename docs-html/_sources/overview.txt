Overview

:abbr:`AOIC (ANOPP2 OpenMDAO Interface Code)` is an interface code written in Python developed at :abbr:`NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)` :abbr:`LaRC (Langley Research Center)` that offers an ability to use :abbr:`ANOPP2 (Aircraft NOise Prediction Program 2)` to optimize designs using :abbr:`OpenMDAO (Open Multi-disciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization)`. 
The AOIC contains two classes: the first interacts with ANOPP2 for setting the problem to be optimized and the second specifies the conditions for optimization.  
The AOIC developed to solve a simple case of finding the location of maximum noise along a sideline parallel to the flight path during an aircraft takeoff is provided and explained.
